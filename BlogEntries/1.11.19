Its the start of November and although officially (or as per a quick google search) Autumn startedon 23rd September but now it seems to be in full effect. Last week every thing looked so beautiful with so many colors every where and just in the blink of an eye all that beauty disappeared to be replaced with gray skies and dead foliage. 
This makes me think of how fragile appearances could be. What was so amazing to look at yesterday is gone in a blink. 
But as Fitzgerald said "Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall". I agree with this. I would say that the changing of the seasons is a gentle reminder to us that things always keep changing, If your life is surrounded by  grey clouds of winter then dont worry as sooner or later spring will bring back the colors, and if your life is as colorful as decidous trees in the height of Autumn, then one must avail the opportunity to take in every moment, breath in every gust of fresh air and appreciate the beauty in what ever form it may be because the seasons may change any moment.
