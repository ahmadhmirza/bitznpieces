            <h2> The Commute.</h2>
            <p>Everyday I commute about 3 hours back and forth between work and home, as a 
                rough estimate I would say I spend roughly about 4 hours per day on public 
                transport. That includes a bus, U-bahn(or the subway in english) and the company 
                shuttle. Sometimes I take a book to read on my way, sometimes I listen to music 
                & sometimes I just like to sit and observe the people around me. I would say the 
                last part is the most interesting. 
            </p>
            <p>More than 90% (not an official statistic ofcourse!) of the people are burried so 
                deep in their cell phones, flicking through Instagram posts (or maybe reddit or
                pintrest), some are just staring off out into the open space totally zoned out 
                or so deep in thought that it makes me wonder what they might be thinking about,
                I find my self in this state often as well but to be honest usually there is 
                absolutely nothing going through my mind, I like to think that when this happens
                my mind resets and lets go of all the unnecessary things that it might have 
                accumulated through the day, but who knows!
            </p>
	        <p>The thing that I find most funny is the behavior of people sitting opposite to
                each other. One can see(or feel?) the effort every one puts to not make 
                eye-contact with the person sitting straight in front of them by looking over 
                their shoulder or at an empty spot where nothingn remotely interesting is 
                happening, and if an eye contact is made every one is quick to adjust their
                 gaze to go back to one of the empty and uninteresting spots. What drives this 
                 behavior in adults because its always with small babies if one makes eye-contact 
                 and gives some small acknowledgement, unless something really important is going 
                 through their minds (like when would be the perfect time to poop) the response 
                 is usually a really heart warming smile.
            </p>
            <p>I always wonder as to what happens while growing up that we loose this beautiful 
                reaction to the people around us and replace it instead with awkward shuffling 
                and it always amuses me as to how being so connected digitally is making us veritably
                so disconnected.</p>
