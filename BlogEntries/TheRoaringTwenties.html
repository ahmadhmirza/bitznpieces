            <h2> The Roaring Twenties or The Unrelenting Twenties</h2>
            <p> When this year started, there was so much hype on social media and the references to 
                the novel The Great Gatsby and its subsequent movie adaptation with the same title featuring
                Leonardo DiCaprio were flying around. For a short time it actually seemed that maybe this year just might
                turn out to be a great big party afterall. But to every ones surprise it has been a complete opposite.
            </p>
            <p> But now that we are almost through the first quarter of the year, it seems that our planet earth
                and the human race is kind of just running on borrowed time. I would say that 2020 is the year equivalent
                of day/date "Friday the 13th". So far we have seen the following things happen :
                    * An almost nuclear war, thankfully it didnt happen.
                    * The Australian bush files, culminating in the death of millions of animals and a huge climatic disaster.
                    * And last but not least, outbreak of the Corona virus, more formally known as COVID-19 
            </p>
	        <p> At the moment most of the human beings are supposed to be observing #socialdistancing by isolating
                themselves in their homes (which i must say sadly many are not observing putting people around them at risk).
                This outbreak has already caused so many deaths and brought the civilization to its knees, a shortage of toilet papers and 
                another recession looming on the horizon.
            </p>
            <p> I really hope that we can come out of these trying times soon, stronger than before and hopefully with not a lot of damage.
                On a lighter note i think this corona virus situation gave us a ton of fun memes tho!
