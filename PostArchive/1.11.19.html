            <h2> Beginning of November and Autumn.</h2>
            <p>Its the start of November and although officially (or as per a quick google search) 
            Autumn started on 23rd September but now it seems to be in full effect or "fall" effect ;). Last week 
            everything looked so beautiful with so many colors every where and just in the blink
            of an eye all that beauty disappeared to be replaced with gray skies and dead foliage. 
            </p>
            <p>This makes me think of how fragile appearances could be. What was so amazing to look 
            at yesterday is gone in a blink.
            </p>
	        <p>But as Fitzgerald said "Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall".
            I agree with this. I would say that the changing of the seasons is a gentle reminder
            to us that things always keep changing, If your life is surrounded by  grey clouds
            of winter then dont worry as sooner or later spring will bring back the colors, and
            if your life is as colorful as decidous trees in the height of Autumn, then one must
            avail the opportunity to take in every moment, breath in every gust of fresh air
            and appreciate the beauty in what ever form it may be because the seasons may
            change any moment.
