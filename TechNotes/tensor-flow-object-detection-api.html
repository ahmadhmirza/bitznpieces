            <h2> Introduction to Object-Detection using Tensorflow</h2>
            <p> Machinelearning and AI is all the hype these days and a big percentage of students find themselves working towards solving a problems using
                one of the several tools available for dealing with ML problems.
                As far as I can see, object detection is the most common AI problems that one tries to solve when starting off on this path.
                In my opinion google has done a terrific job with TensorFlow, and the Object-Detection API not much is needed to be done to develop a custom
                object detector.
                With this Object-Detection API in place, the only problem left to solve is preparing the data-set for your problem. This in it self could be a huge
                pain sometimes.
            </p>
            
            <p>In this post I thought I would cover on how to get set up with TensorFlow and the TensorFlow Object Detection API, as I also had to go through this process
                which could at times be a little frustrating in itself. I mostly work on linux, so this post is for linux, but i will make an other one for Windows soon.
                Also this would be the first time I am going to be writing a tutorial of any kind so I am pretty sure at the end of it all there will be a huge room for 
                improvement. So lets dive right in.
            </p>
            <h3>TensorFlow</h3>
            <p> What is TensorFlow? It is an opensource library that is commonly used for machine learning applications and to qoute their web-page 
                "TensorFlow makes it easy for beginners and experts to create machine learning models for desktop, mobile, web, and cloud". So pretty niffty and 
                versatile huh?
                At the moment there are two variants of TF available depending on the hardware you plan you use, they are TensorFlow CPU and TensorFlow GPU.
                For the sake of this tutorial I will cover the CPU variant. The processing will be slower here as the GPU is not utilizes for training but 
                theres less steps involved in setting it up.
            </p>
            <p> The first step towards setting up the environment for object detecion, I covered creating python virtual environments in an earlier tutorial,
                so If you have doubts go ahead and hit that tutorial up, otherwise now is the time to create a working directory for the Object-Detection project
                and creating a dedicated virtual-environment for the project.
            </p>
