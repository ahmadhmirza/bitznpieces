        <section class="AboutMe">
	<p> My name is Ahmad and I am from the nice city of Lahore in Pakistan. At the moment I am living in Germany. What I am doing here you ask?
        Well at the moment I am doing a Masters in Embedded Systems and almost finishing up my thesis which I am doing at Robert Bosch GmbH.</p>
    <p> The topic of my thesis, in a broader sense, is related to software development practices for cloud native apps and service-oriented-architecture.
        For the thesis I am working towards developing a platform. The aim is that this platform can be used for inter-company software sharing,
        allowing different departments to share the tools and services with clients and colleagues, via simple API calls.</p>
    <p> My interestes range from software development and tinkering with technology just for the sake of it (I am an engineer so I can't help it).
        Painting is one of my favourite hobbies, in time I will try to add a section to the blog where I can share my "masterpieces", I already do it
        on Instagram but yeah I like showing them off ;). Apart from that I like playing a variety of sports, tennis and volleyball being at the top of the list, and I have 
        been planning on learning to ski and swim but so far I have not gotten to that, fingers crossed for the future me learning these skills.
    </p>
	<p>I always feel that describing yourself is one of the hard things that one could have to do in life. So in time I will update the section if something else 
        comes to my mind ;) ciao for now!</p></section>
