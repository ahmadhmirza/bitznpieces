            <p>Going through life each day, hundreds of thoughts (or thousands perhaps, I have never really though about quanitifying this number, but hey theres is another thought)  go through my mind. So many experiences and interactions happen every day, many of them are just lost to the unconcious but so forgoten forever or maybe stored in a dark dingy corner of the brain from where they can never be accessed again, unless one day humans develop some tech to probe the brain and extract all the information.</p>
            <p> I sometimes feel that some of these lost thoughts, ideas and experiences are worth saving and also sharing with others. Well with this in mind I decided to start writing this blog. First to give some structure to the thoughts that i want to put out there, and secondly to share what I learn in both personal and professional life (Being and embedded software engineer i think this part will mostly revolve around how I solved a problem that i face during one of my projects. </p>
	<p> But yet again i dont want to define exactly what i want to do with this virtual space, i think i will just go with the flow and see how it goes, but you are welcome to peruse and join me in this journey.</p>
