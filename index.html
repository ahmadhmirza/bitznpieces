            <p>Going through life each day, hundreds of thoughts go through my mind (or thousands perhaps, I have never really though about quanitifying this number, 
			but hey theres another thought). So many experiences and interactions happen every day, many of them are just lost
			to the unconcious & forgoten forever or maybe stored in a dark, dingy corner of the brain from where they can never be accessed again, 
			unless one day humans develop some tech to probe the brain and extract all the information.</p>
            <p> I sometimes feel that some of these lost thoughts, ideas and experiences are worth saving and also sharing with others. Well with this in mind I decided
			to start writing this blog. First to give some structure to the thoughts that i want to put out there, and secondly to share what I learn in both personal and professional 
			life . </p>
	        <p> But yet again i dont want to define exactly what i want to do with this virtual space, i think i will just go with the flow and see how it goes, but you are welcome to join me in this journey.</p>
			<p> PS. I just started building this today 01/11/2019, so in case you stumbled across here somehow, the next time you come the page might be much better :)</p>
