        <section class="Intro">
            <h3>Well well well, what do we have here?</h3>
            <p> So I started making this web-page or a blog with the thought in mind that I would like to share and store what I learn while working on the 
                projects related to my graduate studies and several personal projects as I tinker around with things, so that someone else who might be 
                looking so solve the same problems or somewhat related problems could find the information at one place. And also so that if I my self
                have to do some thing again then these articles here would serve as my notes.
            </p>
            <h3>World Map (where to find what):</h3>
            <p>At the moment the web page has two sections. <a href=technotes.html>"Tech Notes"</a> section contains articles and tutorials related to 
                the development tasks that I have had to deal with during my adventures in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">
                netherworld</a>. I update it periodically or when I think that I should make notes of something that I develop or a new thing that I might 
                have learnt along the way.
            </p>
            <p>The <a href=blog.html>"Blog"</a> section is where I would be sharing my thoughts and just ramble about things that might be on 
                my mind or that I might find interesting in the moment. I can already foresee myself updating this section less frequently, but its 
                still nice to have.
            </p>
            <p>One of my favorite pastimes is painting and sketching so I plan to add a section(Art-Gallery) where I can show-case my art. I will get 
                around to it soon, but I thought that I will add this point here so it will act as a reminder to me. Anyhow, feel free to peruse 
                the articles I post here and If you have any feedback do let me know. :)

                Ahmad.
