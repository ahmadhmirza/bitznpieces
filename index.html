        <section class="Intro">
            <p>Going through life each day, hundreds of thoughts go through out mind (or thousands perhaps, I have never really thought about quanitifying 
                this number, but hey theres another thought). So many experiences and interactions happen every day, many of them are just lost
                to the unconcious & forgoten forever or maybe stored in a dark, dingy corner of the brain from where they can never be accessed again, 
                unless one day humans develop some tech for extracting information from the brain, although I think such technology might be in that 
                moral gray area?</p>
            <p> Anyhow, I sometimes feel that some of these lost thoughts, ideas and experiences are worth saving and also sharing with others. Well with 
                this in mind I decided to start writing this blog. First to give some structure to the thoughts that i want to put out there, and secondly 
                to share what I learn in both personal and professional life (or just to ramble sometimes) </p>
	        <p> But yet again I dont want to define exactly what I want to do with this virtual space, I think I will just go with the flow and see how it goes, 
                but you are welcome to join me in this journey.</p>
